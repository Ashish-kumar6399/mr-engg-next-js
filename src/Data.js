Automated Control Panel System contains analog pressure meter for displaying pressure of each incoming bank and main line gas pressure. As soon as the gas in one bank runs below set pressure, it sounds an alarm and switches to the other bank. Specific colored LED lights indicate the bank in use and the bank on standby. The device also indicates whether the gas pressure is in normal or low along the banks and the mains. The Digital Automated Control Panel displays actual pressure in each bank. The feature of parallel system is available in which multiple displays are placed at different locations (or floors) which also show the same indicators as in the main System. These panels come with RS-485 Modbus interface for BMS connectivity. Provision is made for adding external NO/NC interface for each bank individually.

Nurse Call system makes the patient administration efficient and greatly simplifies patient care. The patient can press the appropriate button when he requires assistance, which will then show on the corridor and main panels. If the nurse is near the room, she will see the corridor panel light and immediately assist the patient. Otherwise, the attendant at the main panel can acknowledge the call, which will light up the LED ’waiting’ on the bed panel informing the patient his call has been acknowledged. The main panel displays the corridor wise and room wise segregation of panels. The usual problems associated with installing such systems are extensive and complicated wiring.
